    <p>
      I am a full-stack JavaScript developer. I started my journey into
      programming in 2015 as a Software Engineering student at Brigham Young
      University-Idaho. After consuming every programming class I
      could—including intermediate object-oriented programming using the C++
      language, and data structures—I decided to increase the pace of my
      learning by attending a coding bootcamp. In Jan of 2017 I began the
      full-stack JavaScript development program at DevMountain. There I was able
      to put my skills to use and build real-world applications that solidified
      my programming knowledge and passion. Web development is my creative
      channel and I love constantly being able to learn new technologies,
      improve my skills, and design and develop intuitive, fluid web user
      experiences.
