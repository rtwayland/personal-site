				<h1>Software Engineer</h1>
				<p className="max-w-[800px]">
					I am a full-stack JavaScript developer. I started my journey into programming in 2015 as a Software
					Engineering student at Brigham Young University-Idaho. After consuming every programming class I
					could—including intermediate object-oriented programming using the C++ language, and data structures—I decided
					to increase the pace of my learning by attending a coding bootcamp. In Jan of 2017 I began the full-stack
					JavaScript development program at DevMountain. There I was able to put my skills to use and build real-world
					applications that solidified my programming knowledge and passion. Web development is my creative channel and
					I love constantly being able to learn new technologies, improve my skills, and design and develop intuitive,
					fluid web user experiences.
